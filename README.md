  <h2> Overview </h1>
  <p> JWT Basics, it's a project provided by freecodecamp in order to teach how to use Jason Web Token, using it in a simple application.
  The main idea is validate entrance by user and if the user has enter credentials sucessfully he can access dashboard ' page ' ( this 2 parts were made in same page ).</p>
  
  <p> What was used ? </p>
    <ul>

      <li> Express Js </li>
      <li> Nodemon </li>
    </ul>
    
  <p> Postman Routes </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Dashboard - localhost:3000 /api / v1 / dashboard ( get ) </li>
      <li> Login / Register - localhost:3000 /api / v1 / login ( post ) </li>
    </ul>
   
  <p> Ps: Connection with MongoDb wasn't made despite Db archive. Principle idea is to improve back end concepts then front end application was previous made, not by me.</p>
